# MALICE
Detects scans, breaches &amp; anomalies from firewall logs, Nmap scans &amp; live packets. Parses logs → scans → captures → labels attacks with heuristics → trains Keras model in one pipeline. Lightweight, offline, zero SaaS. If it moves wrong, MALICE sees it.
⭐ Star if you want smarter defense.
